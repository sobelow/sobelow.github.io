### [v0.10.0](#v0100)

Sobelow occasionally checks for updates. Historically, it has stored a timestamp 
in the root of your application in the .sobelow file. You've likely noticed, and 
maybe even added it to .gitignore. 

However, with [v0.9.0](#v090), Sobelow got some much needed improvement to the 
false positive management. This functionality also uses .sobelow, so you might not 
want to ignore the file anymore.

To address these changes, the update timestamp has been moved to a global config 
file inside \~/.sobelow. You also will no longer have an annoying .sobelow file to 
ignore if you aren't managing false positives. Yay!

This should not be a breaking change. And, as always, you can opt-out of the update 
check entirely using the `--private` flag. 

Notes: 

* Enhancements
  * Sobelow now uses "~/.sobelow/sobelow-vsn-check" for update checks
  * The ".sobelow" file in your project root is for `--mark-skip-all` only
