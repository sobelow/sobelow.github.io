### [v0.10.1](#v0101)

Sobelow now stores `--mark-skip-all` data in the ".sobelow-skips" file in the root of 
you application. 

If you have previously used this functionality, simply rename your ".sobelow" file 
".sobelow-skips".

Notes:

* Bug fixes
  * Sobelow will use ".sobelow-skips" instead of ".sobelow" in your root directory for `--mark-skip-all`
