### [v0.11.0](#v0110)

The biggest change this version is GitHub action integration. See the [action repo]() for more details.

* Enhancements
  * Sarif output for GitHub integration
  * `--flycheck` flag, which reverses output of `--compact`
* Bug fixes
  * Non-compiling files now return an empty syntax tree instead of 
  causing Sobelow errors.
  * Command Injection finding description are properly formatted
* Misc
  * If you use Sobelow as a standalone utility (i.e. not as part of 
  a Phoenix application), you now need to install as an escript with 
  `mix escript.install hex sobelow`.
  * Custom JSON serialization replaced with Jason.
