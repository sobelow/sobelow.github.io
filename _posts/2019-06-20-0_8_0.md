### [v0.8.0](#v080)

The output for Sobelow has been improved, and is now more consistent across findings. If 
you are using the JSON output format, you will find that all findings now have three 
common keys, `type`, `file` and `line`. Some findings may have additional keys, but all 
are guaranteed to have these three.

Line output has been changed across the board, and now points directly to vulnerable 
function calls, rather than to the containing function. Where appropriate, this information 
is preserved in an additional header. For example, in Sobelow v0.7.8, a directory traversal 
finding would look something like the following:

```
Traversal.FileModule: Directory Traversal in `File.read!` - High Confidence
File: lib/phoenix_internals_web/controllers/page_controller.ex - index:4
Variable: input


def(index(conn, %{"input" => input})) do
  text(conn, File.read!(input))
end
```

This has been updated and improved for Sobelow v0.8.0.

```
Traversal.FileModule: Directory Traversal in `File.read!` - High Confidence
File: lib/phoenix_internals_web/controllers/page_controller.ex
Line: 5
Function: index:4
Variable: input


def(index(conn, %{"input" => input})) do
  text(conn, File.read!(input))
end
```
