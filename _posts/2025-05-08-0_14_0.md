### [0.14.0](v0140)

* Removed
  * Support for minimum Elixir versions 1.7 - 1.11 (**POTENTIALLY BREAKING** - only applies if you relied on Elixir 1.7 through 1.11, 1.12+ is still supported)
* Enhancements
  * Added support for multiple variations of `SQL.query()`
  * Added support for `System.shell' command introduced in Elixir v1.12
  * Ignore runtime config during `Config.HSTS`
  * Updated developer dependencies (`ex_doc` & `credo`)
* Bug fixes
  * Fixed `is_endpoint?` error in main
  * Fixed findings normalization bug
  * Fixed truncation error
* Misc
  * GitHub Actions test matrix updated (hence the large drop in support for old Elixir versions)
  * Addressed compiler warnings from Elixir v1.18.x
  * Moved from `master` branch to `main`
