### [v0.7.8](#v078)

Sobelow now supports a `--threshold` flag. This can be used to filter out low-confidence 
findings, and may be especially useful in a CI pipeline. This flag accepts a threshold of 
low (default), medium, or high, and will only show findings that meet or exceed that confidence 
level. For example, to only see medium and high-confidence findings, run the following: 

```
$ mix sobelow --threshold medium
```

Although this flag can be useful, be sure to continue validating low-confidence findings 
which may pose security issues.

This update also brings the first of several changes to scan outputs. In particular, finding 
module names are now included in the description, which should simplify the use of flags 
that take a module name as input.
